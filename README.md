# Feed Reader Testing
## Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds where I had to use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write unit tests that will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Installation
In your computer terminal, type
`$> git clone https://github.com/leticiaribeirom/nd-feedreader-tests.git`
or download the ZIP file.
Then, open `index.html` in your favorite browser to see the application. On the bottom of the page you can see the Jasmine Suite with all the tests that I wrote in this projects.
